# README: Breast Cancer Classification Assessment
# Objective
This assessment aims to test the ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset using the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The project involves data preprocessing, implementing various classification algorithms, and comparing their performances.

# Dataset
The dataset utilized is the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. It contains 30 features and a target variable that indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of breast cancer.

# Key Components
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing 
Steps:
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is imported using sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.
Data Exploration: Features and target variables are examined to understand the dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values, if present, are imputed using appropriate techniques like mean or median.
Feature Scaling: Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Justification:
Missing Value Treatment: Prevents disruptions during the model training phase caused by incomplete data.
Feature Scaling: Enhances the performance of distance-based and gradient-sensitive algorithms, such as SVM and k-NN

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation 
The following classification algorithms are implemented:
# Logistic Regression
Description: A linear model used for binary classification that predicts probabilities based on a logistic function.
Suitability: Effective for linearly separable data and interpretable.
# Decision Tree Classifier
Description: A tree-based model that splits data recursively based on feature importance.
Suitability: Handles non-linear relationships and does not require feature scaling.
# Random Forest Classifier
Description: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Suitability: Robust to overfitting and performs well on both linear and non-linear datasets.
# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Description: Constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space to separate classes.
Suitability: Works well for high-dimensional datasets and is effective in cases of clear margin separation.
# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Description: A non-parametric method that classifies data points based on the majority class of their neighbors.
Suitability: Simple to implement and effective for smaller datasets with clear clusters.

3. Model Comparison
Steps:
Train each classifier using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
